Battery internal resistance meter - PIC18

In https://www.rcgroups.com/forums/showthread.php?2809231-Battery-IR-Meter-Circuitboard a wonderful internal resistance meter was created by user vollrathd. The MikroC compiler and libaries were used in the orginal development.

I converted the code to compile and run with the Microchips MPlALB X IDE. http://www.microchip.com/ 

I also provided many enhancments and a few bug fixes.
